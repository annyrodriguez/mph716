# Lesson 6a: Biostats 1 Review

In this lesson, we will review what you should have learned in Biostats 1. The topics will include:

-   Introduction to Data
-   Probability
-   Distribution of Random Variables
-   Inference

This lesson is not meant to **teach** you these items, but simply **refresh** your memory.
We will learn how to run all of these items in R/RStudio.

## Chapter 1 refresher: Data and variables

### Types of variables

You should already be familiar with the distinction between:

- **Categorical variables** (e.g., sex, race/ethnicity, region)
- **Numeric variables** (e.g., age, BMI, blood pressure)

In R, this distinction affects:
- which summaries are appropriate  
- how plots are created  
- how variables enter regression models  

---

### Observations and units of analysis

Each row in a dataset represents **one observational unit**.

Examples:
- one person (NHANES)
- one country-year (Gapminder)
- one clinic visit  

Before analyzing any dataset, you should always be able to answer:

> What does one row represent?

---

### Study design and causality

Chapter 1 distinguishes between:

- **Observational studies**
- **Experimental studies**

You should be able to explain:
- whether a study allows causal conclusions  
- why most public health datasets support **associational**, not causal, claims  

---

### Problem sets

Complete problems from the OpenIntro Book 1.1, 1.3, 1.9, 1.12, 1.16, 1.26, 1.28, 1.33., 1.35, 1.36

---

## Chapter 2 refresher: Probability

### What probability represents

Probability describes the **long-run behavior** of a random process.

A probability:
- quantifies uncertainty  
- does not predict individual outcomes  

In public health contexts, probabilities are often expressed as risks or proportions.

---

### Conditional probability and independence

You should be able to reason about:
- probabilities given additional information  
- whether events are independent or related  

These ideas support later discussions of risk factors and outcomes.

---

### Common misconceptions

A key goal of Chapter 2 is recognizing incorrect reasoning about chance.

You should be able to explain why:
- past outcomes do not “force” future outcomes  
- randomness does not imply lack of structure  

---

### Numerical summaries

Key numerical summaries you should already recognize:

- mean  
- median  
- standard deviation  
- range  
- interquartile range  

In this course, you will:
- compute these in R  
- report them using **inline code**  
- interpret them in writing  

Example reminder (conceptual):

The mean describes the average, while the standard deviation describes variability.

---

### Shape, center, and spread

When describing a numeric variable, you should think about:

- **center** (mean or median)  
- **spread** (SD or IQR)  
- **shape** (symmetric, skewed, multimodal)  

These ideas will come up again when we assess model assumptions.

---

### Problem sets

Complete problems from the OpenIntro Book 2.1, 2.5, 2.9, 2.11, 2.16, and 2.17.

---

## Chapter 3 refresher: Distributions of random variables

### Random variables

A **random variable** assigns a numerical value to the outcome of a random process.

You should be able to:
- define the random variable in context  
- state whether it is **discrete or continuous**  

This skill is essential for understanding model outcomes later in the course.

---

### Probability distributions

A probability distribution describes:
- which values are more or less likely  
- how variability is structured  

The book introduces common distributions conceptually (e.g., binomial, normal), without emphasizing computation.

---

### Shape, center, and spread

You should be able to describe a distribution in terms of:
- typical values  
- variability  
- skewness or symmetry  

These ideas will reappear when assessing model assumptions.

### Purpose of visualization

Plots help us:
- identify patterns  
- detect outliers  
- compare groups  
- assess relationships  

In this course, visualization is not optional — every plot must be **interpreted in writing**.

---

### Matching plots to variable types

You should already know:

- categorical → bar charts  
- numeric → histograms, boxplots  
- two numeric variables → scatterplots  
- numeric vs categorical → boxplots  

We will implement these using `ggplot2`, but the **statistical reasoning** comes first.

---

### Problem sets

Complete problems from the OpenIntro Book 3.1, 3.4, 3.8, 3.18, 3.20, 3.21, 3.43, 3.57.

---

## Chapter 4 refresher: Foundations of inference

### Why inference is needed

Chapter 4 explains why we cannot rely on a single sample to know a population value exactly.

Key ideas include:
- sampling variability  
- uncertainty in estimates  

Inference provides tools to quantify this uncertainty.

---

### Confidence intervals (conceptual)

A confidence interval gives a **range of plausible values** for a population parameter.

You should be able to:
- interpret a confidence interval in words  
- explain what it does *not* mean  

This skill is critical for reporting results in manuscripts.

---

### Hypothesis testing (logic only)

You should recognize:
- the role of a null hypothesis  
- what a small p-value suggests conceptually  

You are not expected to memorize testing procedures at this stage.


### Why probability matters in public health

Probability underlies:
- sampling variability  
- uncertainty in estimates  
- confidence intervals  
- statistical inference  

Even when we do not calculate probabilities directly, we rely on probabilistic reasoning.

---

### Sampling vs population

Key distinction:

- **Population**: the group we want to understand  
- **Sample**: the group we observe  

Most public health data are samples, even large ones.

This distinction motivates:
- uncertainty estimates  
- cautious interpretation  

---

### Problem sets

Complete problems from the OpenIntro Book 4.1, 4.4, 4.7, 4.12, 4.16, 4.20, 4.24.

---

## Chapter 5 refresher: Inference for numerical data

### Estimating and comparing means

Chapter 5 applies inference ideas to numerical outcomes.

You should be comfortable:
- identifying the parameter being estimated  
- explaining comparisons between groups conceptually  

---

### Statistical vs practical significance

A recurring theme is that:
- statistical significance does not equal importance  
- context and magnitude matter  

This distinction is central to public health interpretation.

---

### Scope of inference

You should always consider:
- who was studied  
- who the results apply to  

This affects how findings are communicated responsibly.

---

### Variability and uncertainty

Two important ideas:

1. Different samples give different results  
2. We quantify this variability using statistical methods  

This is why:
- confidence intervals exist  
- p-values are used (with caution)  

---

### Confidence intervals (conceptual)

A confidence interval provides a **range of plausible values** for a population parameter.

In this course, you will:
- compute confidence intervals in R  
- report them using inline code  
- interpret them in plain language  

Example interpretation:

> We are reasonably confident the true population value lies within this range.

---

### Statistical significance vs public health relevance

You should already know that:

- statistical significance does not imply importance  
- large samples can detect small differences  
- context and magnitude matter  

This distinction is critical in public health writing.

---

### Problem sets

Complete problems from the OpenIntro Book 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.8, 5.17, 5.19, 5.24, 5.36, 5.41, 5.44.

## Connecting OpenIntro concepts to R and Quarto

Here is how these concepts show up technically in this course:

| Concept | How it appears in this course |
|------|-------------------------------|
| Variables | Column types in datasets |
| Observations | Rows in data frames |
| Summaries | `mean()`, `sd()`, `summary()` |
| Visualization | `ggplot2` |
| Inference | regression estimates and confidence intervals |
| Interpretation | inline code + written text |

Statistics guide **what we do**; R helps us **do it reproducibly**.

---

## What you are expected to remember

You are **not** expected to memorize formulas.  

You **are** expected to:

- recognize variable types  
- choose appropriate summaries  
- interpret plots and model output  
- distinguish association from causation  
- communicate uncertainty clearly  

These skills will be assessed repeatedly.

---

## Self-check

Before moving on, ask yourself:

1. Can I identify the outcome and predictor in a question?
2. Do I know which summaries are appropriate for different variables?
3. Can I interpret a confidence interval in words?
4. Can I explain why uncertainty exists?

If any of these feel shaky, briefly revisit OpenIntro Chapters 1–5 alongside this lesson.
