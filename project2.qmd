title: "Project 2 — Cleaning & Preparing Health Data for Analysis (NHANES)"
---

## Purpose of Project 2

This project moves you from global health context into real biomedical surveillance data. You will work with the `NHANES` dataset, which contains nationally
representative health, exam, and behavioral measures from U.S. adults and children.

The goal is to practice:

• working with real-world health data
• cleaning and restructuring data for analysis
• managing missing values
• creating new variables
• documenting analytic decisions
• writing clear and reproducible Quarto reports

This project prepares you for regression modeling and inference in Project 3 and your final manuscript.

## Dataset

We will use the curated NHANES dataset included in the `NHANES` R package.

This dataset includes variables such as:

• demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, income)
• health status
• smoking behavior
• BMI
• blood pressure
• activity levels
• depression screening
• medical conditions

It is real data — including missingness, limitations, and measurement constraints.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

• clean biomedical data using tidyverse tools
• identify and manage missing data
• construct analytic variables
• describe population patterns in health outcomes
• explain cleaning choices transparently
• submit a fully reproducible Quarto report

These are core skills for public health data science.

## Project Focus

You will choose one health outcome, such as:

• Hypertension
• BMI (as continuous or categorized)
• Depression symptoms
• Diabetes status
• Self-rated health
• Smoking status

and examine how it varies across predictors such as:

• age
• sex
• race/ethnicity
• income-to-poverty ratio
• education
• health behaviors

You may propose an alternative outcome with approval.

##Project Tasks

Your Quarto report must include the following sections:

**1. Introduction (≈ 2–3 paragraphs)**

Briefly explain:

• What NHANES is and why it matters in public health
• Your chosen outcome and why it is important
• Key predictors you will examine
• Your broad guiding question

(Example: How is hypertension patterned across age and income?)

Use clear, MPH-appropriate language.

**2. Data Preparation**

Using tidyverse:

• load the NHANES dataset
• select your outcome and predictors
• recode variables as needed (e.g., factors)
• create at least one new variable, such as:
o     age category
o     BMI category
o     income group
o     binary hypertension status
• remove or document missing data
• provide a data dictionary table explaining variables

All choices must be transparent and explained in writing.

**3. Descriptive Statistics**

Produce:

• summary statistics (means, proportions, counts)
• stratified summaries where appropriate
• at least one table formatted for publication style

Use inline R code whenever possible.

**4. Visualizations**

Create at least two figures, such as:

• distributions of your outcome
• outcome by age group
• outcome by race/ethnicity
• outcome by income category
• outcome by smoking status

Each figure must include:

• clear title
• labeled axes
• readable formatting
• a short interpretation paragraph

**5. Missing Data Review**

Briefly describe:

• where missingness appears
• how many cases were removed
• why that matters for interpretation
• potential bias concerns

This introduces ethical & methodological thinking.

**6. Reflection & Interpretation (≈ 3–4 paragraphs)**

Discuss:

• Public-health meaning of the patterns you observe
• Possible explanations for disparities
• Structural or contextual factors
• What you would explore next with modeling

This section begins to sound like an early manuscript Results + Discussion.

## Formatting Requirements

Your submission must:

✔ be written entirely in Quarto
✔ knit without errors
✔ include inline code for reported values
✔ use tidy, readable R code
✔ apply organized section headings
✔ include citations where relevant
✔ use inclusive, professional language

**Target length: 1,200–1,500 words (excluding code)**

## Submission Requirements

Submit:

• your knitted report (word doc)
• your .qmd source file
• your 3MT slide
