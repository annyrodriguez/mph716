# First Things First

This course is designed to help you become **familiar** with R and RStudio, you're not expected to become a professional R programmer at the end of it. There is a learning curve and there will be moments where you might want to give up (or throw your computer), but I *encourage* you to stick with it. One day, after practicing and potentially crying about it, it will click and you will be so happy you stuck with it. **I believe in you**.

## Important Resources

I've designed this course using free online resources - since R, itself, is a free program. You're going to want to bookmark the following resources as you will definitely be using these for the duration of this course (and possible beyond):

# What is Data Science?

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on: 

- collecting data,
- cleaning and managing data,
- analyzing data,
- and communicating insights to support decision-making.

It combines skills from:

- statistics,
- computer programming,
- data visualization,
- and domain knowledge.

In public health, data science is used to turn complex health data into actionable evidence.


## Why data science matters in public health.

Public health decisions affect entire populations. Data science allows public health professionals to:

  - identify health disparities,
  - monitor disease trends,
  - evaluate interventions,
  - and allocate resources effectively.

Without data science, public health decisions would rely more heavily on anecdotal evidence rather than systematic analysis.


## Types of data used in public health data science

Public health data come from many sources, including:

  - surveillance systems,
  - surveys and questionnaires,
  - electronic health records,
  - clinical trials,
  - administrative and claims data,
  - environmental and geographic data.

Data science methods help integrate these data sources into a coherent analytical framework.


## Key applications of data science in public health

### Disease surveillance and outbreak detection

Data science helps:

  - detect unusual patterns in disease incidence,
  - identify emerging outbreaks,
  - track disease spread over time and across locations.

Timely analysis can inform rapid public health responses.


### Health disparities and equity

Data science allows researchers to:

  - examine differences in health outcomes across populations,
  - identify structural and social determinants of health,
  - quantify inequities by race, ethnicity, income, geography, and language.

These analyses support equity-focused public health interventions.


### Program evaluation and policy analysis

Public health programs and policies must be evaluated to determine whether they work.

Data science supports:

  - impact evaluation,
  - cost-effectiveness analysis,
  - longitudinal and causal modeling,
  - evidence-based policy making.



### Predictive modeling and risk assessment

Using historical data, data science can:

  - predict disease risk,
  - identify high-risk populations,
  - support prevention and early intervention strategies.

These models complement traditional epidemiologic approaches.


## The role of R in public health data science

R is widely used in public health because it:

  - supports statistical modeling,
  - handles large and complex datasets,
  - creates publication-quality visualizations,
  - enables reproducible research through scripts and Quarto documents.

Learning R allows public health professionals to implement data science workflows transparently and efficiently.


## Reproducibility and transparency

Reproducibility is a core principle of both data science and public health.

Best practices include:

  - writing clean, well-documented code,
  - using scripts and Quarto documents,
  - tracking data processing steps,
  - rerunning analyses from raw data to final results.

Reproducible workflows increase trust in public health findings.


# R and RStudio Basics

## What is R?

R is a **programming language** used for:

  - data analysis and statistics,
  - data visualization,
  - reproducible research,
  - and reporting results.

R itself runs in the background. It does the actual computation, stores objects in memory, and executes your code.

## What is RStudio?

RStudio is an **integrated development environment (IDE)** for R.

Think of R as the engine of a car, and RStudio as the dashboard. RStudio makes it easier to:

  - write and organize code,
  - run analyses,
  - view plots and data,
  - manage files and projects,
  - and create Quarto documents.

You can use R without RStudio, but almost everyone uses R *through* RStudio because it is more efficient and user friendly.

## R vs RStudio (key distinction)

- **R** does the computing  
- **RStudio** helps you interact with R

If R is not installed, RStudio will not work.

## The RStudio interface

When you open RStudio, you typically see four panes.

### Source pane (top-left)

This is where you:

  - write R scripts (`.R`),
  - write Quarto documents (`.qmd`),
  - edit code without running it immediately.

Nothing in this pane runs until you tell R to run it.

### Console pane (bottom-left)

The Console is where:

  - R actually runs code,
  - results and error messages appear,
  - commands are executed line by line.

You can type code directly here, but for reproducibility, most code should live in scripts or Quarto files.

### Environment / History pane (top-right)

The Environment tab shows:

  - objects currently loaded in memory,
  - data frames, vectors, functions, and values.

If you restart R, this pane clears because the session memory resets.

### Files / Plots / Packages / Help pane (bottom-right)

This pane lets you:

  - browse project files,
  - view plots,
  - manage installed packages,
  - read help documentation.

## What is an R session?

An R session is the **current working instance of R**.

During a session:

  - objects live in memory,
  - loaded packages are available,
  - results depend on what you have already run.

When you restart R:

  - memory is cleared,
  - packages must be reloaded,
  - scripts must be re-run.

This is why reproducible workflows matter.

## Writing and running code

### Writing code

Write code in the Source pane, for example:

```{r}
x <- 5
y <- 10
x + y
```

## R & RStudio Keyboard Shortcuts (Quick Reference)

Using keyboard shortcuts will make you faster, reduce errors, and improve reproducibility. These shortcuts work in **RStudio** unless otherwise noted.

:::{.callout-note title="Practice"}


1. Open a new R script.
2. Write a short pipeline using the pipe shortcut.
3. Comment out the code using the comment shortcut.
4. Restart your R session and re-run the script.

## Working with R Libraries

In R, the words **package** and **library** are often used interchangeably.

A **package** is a bundle of:

  - functions (tools you can call),
  - datasets (sometimes),
  - documentation (help files),
  - and other code that expands what base R can do.

A **library** is the collection of installed packages on your computer, and `library()` is the function we use to **load** a package for use in the current session.

## Why do we need packages?

Base R can do a lot, but packages make R powerful and efficient. We use packages to:

  - clean and reshape data more easily,
  - make high-quality plots,
  - import/export many file types,
  - run statistical models and machine learning,
  - write reproducible reports (Quarto),
  - and share standardized tools across projects.

In this course, you’ll use packages so that everyone can run the same code and get the same results.

## Installing vs loading: the key difference

**Install** a package once (or whenever you update R / need a newer version).  
**Load** a package every time you start a new R session and want to use it.

Think of it like an app:

  - Installing is downloading the app to your phone.
  - Loading is opening the app to use it.

## How to install a package

Use `install.packages()` with the package name in quotes.

The first package we will install is `tidyverse`. We will also install `quarto`.
