The spread of residuals is fairly consistent across fitted values, indicating approximately constant variance.\nWhat would indicate a concern:\n\nCurved pattern → possible nonlinearity\nFunnel shape → non-constant variance\n\nYou should identify, not fix, these issues (at least not yet anyways).\n\n\nPlot 2: Normasl Q-Q Plot\nWhat this plot checks:\n\nApproximate normality of residuals\n\nThis matters for:\n\nconfidence intervals\np-values\n\nWhat YOU should look for:\n\nPoints falling roughly along the diagonal line\nSmall deviations at the ends are acceptable\n\nNormality is about the residuals, not the outcome variable itself.\n\nIn this course, you are expected to describe diagnostic plots in words and identify major issues if present, not to diagnose or correct subtle statistical problems.",

    "text": "Purpose of this lesson\nThis lesson introduces multiple linear regression, which allows us to examine the association between a numeric outcome and multiple predictors at the same time. In public health, this is commonly used to estimate adjusted associations, meaning the association between a predictor and an outcome while holding other variables constant.\nThe focus today is interpretation: how to read output, how to write results in plain language, and how to avoid causal claims when the study design is observational.",

Data Preparation\nUsing tidyverse:\n\nload the NHANES dataset\nselect your outcome and predictors\nrecode variables as needed (e.g., factors)\ncreate at least one new variable, such as:\n\nage category\nBMI category\nincome group\nbinary hypertension status\n\nremove or document missing data\nprovide a data dictionary table explaining variables\n\nAll choices must be transparent and explained in writing.\n\n\n3. Descriptive Statistics\nProduce:\n\nsummary statistics (means, proportions, counts)\nstratified summaries where appropriate\nat least one table formatted for publication style\n\nUse inline R code whenever possible.\n\n\n4. Visualizations\nCreate at least two figures, such as:\n\ndistributions of your outcome\noutcome by age group\noutcome by race/ethnicity\noutcome by income category\noutcome by smoking status\n\nEach figure must include:\n\nclear title\nlabeled axes\nreadable formatting\na short interpretation paragraph\n\n\n\n5. Missing Data Review\nBriefly describe:\n\nwhere missingness appears\nhow many cases were removed\nwhy that matters for interpretation\npotential bias concerns\n\nThis introduces ethical & methodological thinking.\n\n\n6. Reflection & Interpretation (≈ 3–4 paragraphs)\nDiscuss:\n\nPublic-health meaning of the patterns you observe\nPossible explanations for disparities\nStructural or contextual factors\nWhat you would explore next with modeling\n\nThis section begins to sound like an early manuscript Results + Discussion.",
